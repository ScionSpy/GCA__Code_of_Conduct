## C) Divisional Stars - During the "Off Season" of Clan Battles.
• 1) The Divisional Star event gives us as a clan an opportunity to receive rewards by fighting along side your clanmates in divisions. Earn stars to receive rewards!

• 2) How To Earn Stars
• • I) Fight as part of a Division with your Clanmates and complete missions to earn stars.
• • • A) To see the list of available missions that you can complete with each clanmate, go to Clans > Division Star and review at the top of the screen.

• • III) Most Events you can also obtain stars in as well! No reason to stop obtaining those special rewards.
• • III) You can get familiar with one-another's playstyle for the upcoming Clan Battles!

• 4) The Do Nots of Div Stars with G-C-A
• • I) Don't log off as soon as you're messaged or invited.
• • II) Don't ignore the messenger, kindly let them know you're not interested.
• • III) Don't leave the div after the first battle, win or loss, to do your own thing, you're not helping anyone, and it's pretty rude..
• • Remember, leadership is paying attention to those who are not participating in clan events, and how they're acting towards members.


## D) Clan Battles - Weekly: Wed, Thur, Sat, Sun 7:30pm - 11:30 EST (4:30pm - 8:30 PST)
• 1) G-C-A requires participation through-out the Clan Battle Season. Seasons are as defined by Wargaming.
• 2) Clan Battles is an End-Game Game mode where two (2) clans go head-to-head and vie to be the last man standing while climbing the ranks to be the top most Clan within the Typhoon League!
• 3) Clan Rules in regards to Clan Battle activity:

• • I) While participating in Clan Battles you MUST be in the respective Clan-Battles Voice Channels!
• • • A) We do not require you to speak and you may remain muted. However we DO require you to *Hear* the battle calls being made, and additional calls, or focus fire orders through-out the duration of battle.
• • • • 1) :alert: When "COMMS" is called, it means "Go Silent!" The Caller or an admin is trying to speak. Continued breach of this will result in mutes.

• • • B) There should be *No* reason other members in the voice channel can hear *Your* game. In fact this can be quite Disruptive!!
• • • • 1) "Torpedo's to Starboard!!" may make more than 1 person look for inbound torps, or show an un-intentional broadside trying to dodge torps that aren't even inbound!! Be respectful to your fellow mates, and ensure a swift Victory!
• • • • 2)  If someone calls you out, please turn down your game, or decrease discord mic sensitivity, or use Push-To-Talk ( PTT )! (Ask for help if needed!)
• • • C) If you are NOT in battle and are on the side-lines, PLEASE mute yourself, or refrain from "External Noises" from distracting the Battlers.
• • • • 1) That Being Said!! NO BATTLERS should have the News, TV shows, etc playing to distract them, and if they do, make it so the *Other* battlers cannot hear it!
• • • • 2) This is VERY disruptive, and prevents the others from accurately hearing the calls being made.

• • II) At the beginning of the battle, keep chatter at a minimal so everyone can hear the battle call!
• • • A) Once the call has been made, additional information may be shared: "That Battleship has 12km radar!", "All cruisers, except the Siegfried have radar!", "Ragnar has a 7.5km radar!"

• • III) During the battle, keep non-related conversation to a minimal after the first 2 minutes.
• • • A) Keep comms clear for the extra call-outs, and focus fires!

• • IV) Stay to the Call!! -- You may voice your opinions or concerns, however once the call has been decided, By the *Caller* do NOT divert!
• • • A) If your instructed to go to the (A) cap, then go to the (A) cap.
• • • B) We do not control you or your ship, play as you feel right, but remember! These are Clan Battles *NOT* Randoms!!
• • • • 1) You are Not fighting to stay alive! Your are fighting to Win, even if that means you and your ship must be sacrificed!
• • • • 2) There are times where you will be solo vs the ENTRE team, you will fight a losing fight and die for the greater good of the team!
• • • C) If you're about to die, and you can ram a ship. Then ram them!! You're going to die! Might as well bring them to Davy Jones with you!
• • • • 1) It's *Always* better to take an enemy with you, than leave them alive to provide additional fire-power to the enemy!

• • V) When a **PUSH** is called, then you are expected to***PUSH***!
• • • A) On a push you do NOT stop, you do NOT go into reverse, you continue forward, calling focus fire and taking out the targets on Your side as quickly and efficiently as possible while pressing your way into the enemy cap like a line-backer!
• • • B) On pushes we are NOT worried about what's going on "over there", only what is going on "In front" of the force. If everyone goes together, and focuses on the same target you can over-whelm even the most entrenched enemies.
• • • • I)  Observe A Cap in this video: https://discord.com/channels/1126377465741324429/1283633726189867030/1294842063229292544

• • VI) Focus Fire, And continue to Focus Fire!!
• • • A) When targets *Are* called they should be your priority targets *Unless* you don't have an angle! Then follow Sub-Section B.
• • • • I) Targets from the Battle Caller or XO on a designated side should be prioritized.
• • • B) If there are no targets being called on your side, they should be prioritized in this order: [ Lowest HP ] first, [ DD ], [ Radar ], [ Cruisers ], [ Battleships ]

• • VII) The Line Up
• • • A) Once you've selected your preferred vessel, do not swap out of it unless approved with the caller. Doing so disrupts the flow of battle, as players are expecting "That" boat, and "That" playstyle.

• • VII) Caller
• • • A) The Caller's call is final. If you do not approve of that, you may leave the Division, or the clan and find elsewhere to go.
• • • • I) We are not here to be rear-ends, however we are here to be Casually, Socially, Competitive and obtain Storm League each and every time.
• • • B) The Caller may bench you for the night or a portion there-of for any reason, you may always join the opposite division if that Caller approves, you may also Merc for other clans, but when that caller benches you for the moment it's done.
• • • • I) Further disruptive activities may lead to your muting on the Discord Server, or removal from the clan if you have escalated thus far.
